Week 2

When designing an app:
  - Flow needs to be intuitive
  - Don't cram everything on one page and into one app
  - If you can do it in 3 click, instead of 4, do it!
  - Use fonts consistently
  - Keep locations of buttons and size of buttons consistent
  - Navigation bars and back buttons

Segue's
  - When a segue is created it enables the button to invoke an internal event handler which transitions to the new page upon clicking
  - Unwind Segue = free up memory of the previous screen, go back pages
  -
